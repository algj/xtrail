# ðŸ’« xtrail

xtrail is a lightweight program designed to render trails behind the mouse cursor on X11-based systems. This doesn't require a compositor (but highly recommended for some programs) and utilizes dithering techniques for rendering with a minimalistic 1-bit "transparency" depth.

## Features

- Renders trails behind the mouse cursor with multiple render types.
- Supports customizable trail length and thickness.
- Adjustable mouse position history count.
- Configurable refresh rates for both rendering and mouse tracking.
- Trail is hidden when cursor is invisible (e.g., gaming)
